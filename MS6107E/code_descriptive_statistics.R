#The Boston Housing dataset includes housing prices and related factors in the Boston area. 
#The dataset was obtained from information collected by the U.S. Census Service concerning housing 
#in the area of Boston, Massachusetts. The dataset also comprises 506 observations on 14 variables.

#The variables include:
#Crim - The crim variable represents the per capita crime rate by town.
#Zn - The zn variable represents the proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
#Indus - The indus variable represents the proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
#Chas - The chas variable represents whether the property is located along the Charles River or not.
#Nox - The nox variable represents the nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million) in the air.
#Rm -The rm variable represents the average number of rooms per dwelling.
#age: This variable represents the proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.
#Dis -The dis variable represents the weighted distances to five Boston employment centres.
#Rad - The rad variable represents the index of accessibility to radial highways.
#Tax - The tax variable represents the full-value property-tax rate per $10,000.
#Ptratio - The ptratio variable represents the pupil-teacher ratio by town.
#Black - The black variable represents the proportion of blacks by town.
#Lstat - The lstat variable represents the percentage of the lower status of the population.
#Medv - The medv variable represents the median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s.

#correlation
#Pearson correlation is often used for quantitative continuous variables that have a linear relationship
#Spearman correlation (which is actually similar to Pearson but based on the ranked values for 
#each variable rather than on the raw data) is often used to evaluate relationships involving at 
#least one qualitative ordinal variable or two quantitative variables if the link is partially linear
#Kendallâ€™s tau-b which is computed from the number of concordant and discordant pairs is often used for
#qualitative ordinal variables
